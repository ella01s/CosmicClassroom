# CosmicClassroom
CosmicClassroom is an educational platform designed to demystify the complexities of space dynamics and control. 

How to use the program
- run the program from the App class. 
- Path to App class = src/main/java/functionality/App.java
- You will be requested to provide a username
- If you provide a username that already exists in the database, you will access the user history for that username. You will be able to tell this is the case because the following message will be written to the terminal:
Welcome back "username". If that user history does not apply to you, re-run the program and chose another name. 
- If you have provided a username that is new to the database, you will see the message: Welcome "username".
- The program follows a question and answer format.
- Follow the instructions in the terminal to participate in the classroom.
